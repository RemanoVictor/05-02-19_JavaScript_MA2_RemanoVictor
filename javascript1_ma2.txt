5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.


The scope of a variable refers to how accessible the variable is depending on the position of its declaration.

There are two main types of scope: 

zGlobal scope and local scope.

If a variable is declared INSIDE a function, then it is only available within that function and is deleted once the function has run it's course, this is known as a local scope.

however, if a variable is declared OUTSIDE of a function, then it is accessible and can be used throughout the document and program.
